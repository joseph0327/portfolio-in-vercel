        Since graduating from college, I have silently battled a persistent fear of failure, a challenge that has followed me since childhood. Despite this, I remain resilient, striving to overcome it each day. My fascination with technology drives my passion for learning, even though Iâ€™ve faced setbacks and rejections when applying for tech roles. I firmly believe in my potential to secure a fulfilling career and dedicate myself to continuous growth, not only to achieve my goals but also to support my parents and contribute to their well-being.
    </p>
     <p class="card-text">
        Throughout my journey, perseverance has been my constant companion. Despite facing significant financial challenges during my education, my parents' unwavering support enabled me to graduate successfully. Armed with determination, I ventured into the job market, aiming to secure a role as a developer. However, limited opportunities in that field initially steered me toward the call center industry.
    </p>
     <p class="card-text">
        My first technical role was in tech support, which, although brief at seven months, opened the door to a position as a desktop support professional. While the pay was modest, the role was immensely rewarding, with a broad scope of responsibilities that allowed me to grow both technically and personally. My dedication to meeting quotas and assisting others earned me a Hive Lead position. After three years, I sought new opportunities to align my career with my financial goals.
    </p>
     <p class="card-text">
        This search led me to an IT support role at a web hosting company. Though I continued to develop my skills, I sought greater fulfillment. A contract role as an IT Support Engineer followed, providing invaluable hands-on experience and exposure to new challenges.
     </p>
     <p class="card-text">
        I then joined Optum as part of their IT Service Desk team. While initially challenging, I quickly adapted and streamlined my workflow. However, opportunities for advancement within the organization were limited. Undeterred, I took charge of my professional growth by leveraging resources like Coursera and internal training programs to upskill myself in cloud engineering, web development, and data analytics.
    </p>
     <p class="card-text">
        Now, I am seeking a role that offers meaningful career growth, the chance to specialize in one of these fields, and the financial stability to support my family. With a foundation of resilience, continuous learning, and a passion for technology, I am eager to contribute and excel in a dynamic organization.
